# This function is used in the FastAPI routes to get a database session.
# It ensures that the session is properly closed after use.
# This is important for resource management and to avoid connection leaks.
# The session is created using the SessionLocal factory, which is bound to the engine.
# The session is yielded to the route handler, and once the request is completed,
# the session is closed in the finally block.
# This is a common pattern in FastAPI applications that use SQLAlchemy.
# It allows for easy management of database connections and ensures that each request
# has its own session.
